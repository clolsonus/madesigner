Want to build a super quick super cheap wing? Consider dollar tree
foam board.  For smaller to midsize models (electrics) you can build
surprisingly sturdy, surprisingly nice flying wings.  Add paint or
colored tape or decals to finish it off.

Simply input the desired wing chord and the code spits out the
unfolded dimensions.  You can quickly mark these out on a piece of
foamboard, decide for yourself what wing span you want and the shape
of the wing tip, and cut it out.  A few minutes to score, fold, and
glue, and you have yourself a basic wing!

You can grab the python script there:
