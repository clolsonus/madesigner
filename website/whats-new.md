# v0.5 - not yet released

* Link your wing structures together to make multipanel wings.  For
  example a classic "polyhedral" glider wing.
* Much improved (and far more buildable) control surface and hinge
  designs.
* Support for flat stock trailing edges (similar to the guillows style
  wing builds.)
* Vastly improved part nesting in the layout sheets.
* I have actually used the program for some laser cut tests!  This is
  exciting.

# v0.4 - December 27, 2013

* Control surfaces!  Specify the hinge line and the start/end station
  and your control surface is built automatically.  Supports multiple
  independant control surfaces per wing.
* Version checking.  Alert if a newer version is available for
  download.
* Warn if trying to build before all design changes have been saved.
* Delete wings from previous design when opening a new design.
* Spars are now always vertically aligned after rib is rotated for
  twist/washout.
* Stringers are always aligned flush/tangent to the surface of the
  rib.
* Saved .mad files (xml format) are now beautified rather than all
  stuffed together on a single line (better for version control or
  human editing.)
* If asking to view the design in 3d, check if file is saved (clean)
  and built since last save.
* Fix output of .svg (plans/templates/laser cutter sheets) so they are
  created in the same folder as the original .mad file.

# v0.3 - December 19, 2013

* Add a suite of examples that illustrate many of the software's
  capabilities.
* Support for curved chord/taper wings.  This is done by defining a
  spline curve that evaluates to the chord at that point in the wing.
  See docs and examples for more details.
* Support for curved sweep wings.  This is probably a less useful
  feature, but is available nonetheless.  Instead of specifying a
  sweep angle, a spline curve can define the amount of forward/aft
  shift of the wing ribs relative to the span of the wing.  Again see
  the docs for specific explanation and examples.

# v0.2 - December 18, 2013

* Add helper functions for selecting root and tip airfoils.
* Support for separate size root and tip chords (allows generation of
  tapered wings.)
* Changes to combo box trigger internal change detection.
* Clean/dirty management, system suggest save if design is changed
  before quitting or loading a new design.
* Deleted structures also make the model 'dirty' (needs to be saved.)
* Bug fixes.  (Found an edge case in the generation of 3d sheeting
  that was exposed on wings that blend from one airfoil to another.)

# v0.1 - December 15, 2013

* Initial GUI front end interface to working back end build library.
* Single .exe windows version via PyInstaller
* InnoSetup setup packaging for Windows
* Bug fixes when generating 3d model for wings with sweep and
  dihedral.
* Integrated creator, builder, and viewer into single GUI.
* Simple XML format for saving model designs.

# v0.05 (unreleased) - February 21, 2013

* Switch to using a polygon clipping library for many internal
  functions (making cutouts much more robust.)
* Wing skinning
* Shaped lightening holes (that follow the interior contour of the
  rib)
* Support for "linked" wing panels (i.e. a polyhedral glider wing.)
* Visualize the exact model that is generated in 3d.
* Variety of bug fixes and clean ups.

# v0.0 (unreleased) - February 2, 2013

* Initial revision
* Airfoil blending, scaling, rotation
* Smoothing, resampling, and adaptive fitting of airfoil curves
* Cutting out basic shapes from airfoils for leading/trailing edges,
  spars, stringers, lightening holes, etc.
* Best fit of leading edge cutout.
* Best fit of trailing edge stock to airfoil shape.
* Generates actual size build plans
* Supports curved chord/taper function
* Supports curved sweep function
* Higher level function: cut flaps or ailerons into the wing
  structure.
