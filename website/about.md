The idea for MAdesigner was born out of a project to design blended
body flying wing UAS.  Going back to the the later 2000's: we went
through several design iterations, created a beautiful prototype (by
hand) and then wanted to engineer molds for production.  So I designed
some custom scripts in perl to generate the cross section shapes and
blend them together.  Later I rewrote everything in python and added
quite a bit of functionality to support traditional balsa built up
frame work wing designs.  There is much more to that could be done
including fuselage structures, but there is only so much time in the
day.

Here is our "ATI Resolution 3" made from molds machined from the "perl
computed" mold shapes.  It was a truly eye catchiing design with a
nice in-flight presence, but it was really hard to compete with all
the similar size super-inexpensive foam designs on the market.  Our
design was very simple, robust, and could be made water proof ... but
onwards and upwards. :-)
