# Windows

* [Download Model Airplane Designer here](http://mirrors.ibiblio.org/pub/mirrors/flightgear/ftp/MAdesigner)

# Extras

* [Inkscape](http://inkscape.org) -- MAdesigner generates plans,
  templates, and laser cutter layouts in ".svg" format (Scalable
  Vector Graphics format.)  Many software tools can open this format,
  but if you don't have something you like better, I highly recommend
  Inkscape.  It allows you to load and view your .svg files, and then
  you can save them as pdf or print them, or email them to your friend
  who owns a laser cutter and a wide format plotter.

# Source Code

* MAdesigner is open-source!  Take a peek under the hood here:
