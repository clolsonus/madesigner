# Model Airplane Designer

MAD is a model airplane rapid design system.  The user inputs what
they want at a high level using a form based interface.  The MAD
system then builds an exact 3d model of the design, 2d full size build
plans, individual part templates and layouts for laser cut sheets.

##  How is MAD different from other tools?

* MAD is not a CAD tool.  CAD tools are often very expensive and can
  take years to learn well enough to use effectively.  MAD is quick
  and easy to learn yet still produces high quality professional grade
  output.
* MAD automatically generates laser cutter layout sheets that can be
  directly cut by your favorite laser cutter.  This allows you to
  create more complex and ambitious designs that are still as simple
  and as straightforward to build as a trainer.
* MAD can do quite a lot, but it cannot do everything.  If you need
  everything you may be a good candidate for purchasing and learning
  an advance 3d solid modeler.
* MAD knows how to cut built up ailerons and flaps into your fancy
  curved or tapered wings, and generates all the parts for you.
* MAD makes changing your design fast and easy.  You can switch
  airfoils, move a stringer, add lightening holes, add sheeting, move
  ribs, change span or chord, add twist or sweep -- all in a matter of
  a few seconds.  You don't have to redraw all your parts and
  structures yourself, MAD does this for you automatically, exactly,
  and perfectly every time.
