example01.mad A very simple example
example02.mad Beginning to add typical wing structures.
example03.mad This example begins to add a bit of complexity to show the power of MA designer.
example04.mad Swept wings are no problem.
example05.mad This example demonstrates how easy it is to create a wing that blends from one airfoil at the root to a completely different airfoil at the tip.
example06.mad This example shows how easy it is to create a complex curved wing using a spline curve to define the cord relative to the span of the wing.
example07.mad This example shows how easy it is to create a wing with a curved sweep.
example08.mad Back to a simpler wing plan, but now lets put the ribs where we want them by entering our own station values.
example09.mad With a simple wing plan and custom station positions, let's start adding more features to our wing.
example10.mad We can skin the wing for sheeting. Sheet position at the time of this example is limited, but this example shows typical "D" construction wing sheeting.
example11.mad Stations! Any feature can start and end at any station. You are the engineer and get to decide what you want, how big, and where it starts and ends.
example12.mad This example adds flaps and ailerons to a tapered wing.
example13.mad This example shows how to build a multi-panel, polyhedral wing. In this case the mh43 glider airfoil is chosen. Notice in the Outer wing tab that the panel is "linked" to the "Inner" wing.
